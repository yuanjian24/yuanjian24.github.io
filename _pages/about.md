I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the College of Transportation Engineering at Tongji University. I received my Bachelor degree in Transportation Engineering from Chang'an University. 

My  current research centers on the area of data-driven urban transportation system modeling. I am interested in employing artificial intelligence into transportation system.
